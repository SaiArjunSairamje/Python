    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. By \"interpreted\", we mean that Python code is \"not compiled\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the interpreter reads the code line by line and executes the code. It was developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. Python supports multiple and different programming paradigms, such as 'structural programming', 'object-oriented programming', and 'functional programming'\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also open-sourced and a dynamically typed language. What does dynamically typed mean? In simple words, a programmer using Python need not declare the data types of the variables that they are working with right at the beginning. This allows them the creative freedom to use variables as they please and even modify their type later on- unlike other object-oriented languages like Java and 'C++'.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://scaler.com/topics/images/everyone-uses-python.webp width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of Python and its growing user-base can be credited to the numerous modules and packages that come with Python available. These facilitate code reusability and promote code modularity. Along with that, they make Python very versatile as these libraries make it possible for it to be used across various domains such as \"Django\" and \"Flask\" for Web Development, \"NumPy\" and \"Pandas\" for Data Science, \"PyGame\" for Game Development etc.\n",

    "## <center><ins>3. Why Should You Learn Python?</ins></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Till this point in the article, we have understood what is Python Programming and what is the importance of Python. Now let’s discuss why you should learn Python and why it is called a versatile programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Python is Easy to Use & Learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very simple and easy to learn programming language. It has a very gradual learning curve. Anyone can learn Python because of its simple syntax which almost resembles simple English.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some factors that make Python a beginner-friendly language. Due to its simple syntax, you can focus on the logic part rather than the syntax implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having simple syntax makes it easier for developers to use Python over any other language. Since one has to focus on the logic part, it saves time and increases productivity. This is the reason why Python is used in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Python is Versatile**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Versatile\" means to be able to adapt or to be used for many different functions. Just as the meaning of the word suggests, Python lives up to its claim of versatility. There are countless domains and scenarios where the use of Python saves the day- thus depicting its versatility. Some of the most common use cases for Python are Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Data Science and Software Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "The various frameworks and libraries that have been built for Python are the main reason why it is favourable for these technologies. Some of the most widely used ones are- Django for building Backend using Python, PyTorch for Deep Learning, NumPy and Pandas for Data Science, PyGame for Game Development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Python is a Faster Growing Programming Language**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the comparison between some of the trending programming languages with Python. This is the data of Google trends of the past 12 months..Notice that Python is at the top.\n",

    "All these statistics show that Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Python is used in Data Science**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just knowing “What is Python Programming?” is not enough, we also have to be aware of its industry-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the new oil and data is everywhere. With the passing of every second of every day, more and more data is being generated. Thus, there is a need to manage, analyze and interpret this humongous data. That’s where Data Science comes into the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing data using database systems is not enough and neither is just storing data. The data available can be used to solve a lot of real-world problems- from \"Risk Management\" to building intuitive \"Healthcare solutions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://scaler.com/topics/images/python-libraries-for-data-science.webp width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Our favourite programming language- Python- helps greatly in this. Libraries such as NumPy, PyBrain, Pandas help us in developing innovative Data Science products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s discuss the features of some of those libraries-\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numpy** provides mathematical functions to handle large dimension arrays. It also consists of the functionality of arrays and many functions of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pandas** is a popular library for data manipulation. It provides huge data structures and manipulates numerical tables and time-series data. It is also used for data wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PyBrain** is a Machine Learning library that we can use to test out ML-based algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **PyMySQL** is the library that allows us to interact with an interface that connects MySQL to our codebase- thereby making the access of data easy and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Python** is used in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technology has come a long way and now in our current times, we are successfully able to make machines learn. That’s Machine Learning in a nutshell for you! So it is advisable to learn more about Machine Learning along with the answer to “What is Python Programming?”\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Python for building algorithms and models using Statistics to allow computers to perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common Python libraries and modules that are used in Machine learning are \"Scikit-learn\", \"OpenCV\" and \"TensorFlow\".\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=https://scaler.com/topics/images/python-ai-ml.webp width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like Python is being used in Machine Learning, its presence in the field of Artificial Intelligence is also very significant. Be it the Terminator movies or Star Wars, we have loved watching AIs at play in the movies. Well now, we can use Python to create our very own!\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence is nothing but the intelligence that is not displayed by humans i.e the intelligence depicted by machines. In Python, packages libraries like NLTK and FANN help you build your own AIs. So the next time you want to build your very own digital assistants like Jarvis or a recommender system like Netflix? Start coding in Python without a second thought!\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Python is used in Web Development.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also very popular for Web Development. Python has a lot of libraries and frameworks such as Django, Flask, Web2py, Pyramid etc- which are used extensively to develop the backend and the related APIs. The numerous frameworks make it much easier for developers to develop web applications using Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "**7. Python is used in Automation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not just a programming language but also a scripting language! A scripting language basically allows us to automate our work so that the work can be executed without human intervention. Automation saves both the time and energy of the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundant tasks such as reading-writing files, scraping files from the web can be achieved very easily through automation using scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Python is used for Building GUI**\n",
    "\n",
    "\"GUI\" refers to the interface that a user can use to interact with applications. You can also use Python for building a graphical user interface (GUI). There are many cross-platform GUI toolkits available such as \"PyQt\", Pyside etc. The standard Python GUI library is \"Tkinter\", which is included when we install Python for almost all Operating Systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Python supports numerous testing frameworks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a product is not just enough. We need to ensure that it accurately does what it's supposed to. The process of evaluating the product or application’s proper functioning is known as testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated testing is a well-known context in the field of testing. Python comes with several testing frameworks & libraries that support automated testing for your system.\n",
